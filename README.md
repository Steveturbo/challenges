# Week one challenge.
The challenger this week was to repair and tweak the html and css file as well as writing a read me file.
Below is a list of issues I located on the html.
One of the hyper-text links didn't work.
The text in the paragraph sections ran on.
The footer had an incorrect h2 section.
There were no notations. 

I corrected the hyper-text link by adding an ID.
I corrected the run on paragraphs with a <br />.
Changed the footer h2 to h5.
Changed the title to reflect the page contents.
Made notations as needed.

In the css file I added text alignment properties to center some of the 
paragraph text.
Added notations.

The real problem I had was with Git.
